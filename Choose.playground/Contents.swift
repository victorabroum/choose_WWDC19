 # Choose
 ## A SpriteKit Game based on choices
 
 Hello Judge,
 This is my WWDC 2019 Submission...
 
 My great passion is to create games, and it all got bigger when I first met SpriteKit, since then I have been creating my own games and in everything I can I get involved with this subject because I have learned that whenever I can I must work with what I love.
   
 
 Today I want to tell you a story, and what better way to do this if not through a game 😍
   
 
 
 **Choose** is a game of choice where you decide the future of the hero, depending on your decisions the story may change. Sit back in the chair and get ready to embark on this adventure.
 
 
 With all my ❤️, Victor Vasconcelos
